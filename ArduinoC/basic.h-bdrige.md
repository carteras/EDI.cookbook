# h-bridge controllers

## Learning Intentions 

- Using a H-Bridge controller create a system that controls two motors independently.

## Success Criteria 

At the end of this session you will be able to: 

- control a motor to move forwards and backward
- control a second motor independently of the first 
- use a potentiometer to control speed 

## Parts 

- 1x breadboard
- 1x potentiometer
- 2x motors
- 1x arduino
- 1x L293D h-bridge controller
- 22-ish-x wires
