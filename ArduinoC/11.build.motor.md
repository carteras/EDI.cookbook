# Motor controllers

ðŸ§  Learning Intentions

By the end of this project, students will:

- the principles of by assembling and wiring an Arduino-based robotic car, aligning with the unit's focus on creating products that incorporate these systems
- in to process inputs from ultrasonic sensors and control motor outputs, reflecting the unit's emphasis on programming control systems.
- the impact of robotics and mechanized systems on society and the environment, fostering a critical perspective on the role of automation in modern contexts
- to a robotic system, emphasizing iterative development and problem-solving skills.
- within a team to manage project timelines, resources, and responsibilities, mirroring real-world engineering practices.


âœ… Success Criteria

Students will demonstrate success when they can:

the robotic hardware components, including the L298N motor controller, buttons, and Arduino microcontroller, ensuring all mechanical and electrical connections are secure and functional.

Arduino code that:

- drive a motor forwards and backwards
- make decisions between left and right



## Requirements 

- 4x pushbuttons
- 1x yellow motor
- 1x arduino
- 1x motor driver L298n
- 6x M to M jump leads
- 4x M to F jump leads

### Objective Circuit

Construct the following circuit

I don't have easy access to a motorcontroller so I have hacked something up. You will need to plug your enable, in1, in2, 5v and ground into your motor controller

### Right side (blue side)

Motor controller | Where it goes 
-- | --
GND | Both your Arduino GND <br>external power supply GND
5v  | Arduino 5v  
VMS | External Power Supply Vcc
MOTOR_A top| either red or black on motor a
MOTOR_A bottom | the other on motor a
MOTOR_B top | either red or black on motor b
MOTOR_B bottom | the other on motor b

### Left side (yellow side)

Motor controller | Where it goes 
-- | --
ENA | enableA pin (or 5v arduino)
in1 | en1 pin
in2 | en2 pin 
in3 | en3 pin
in4 | en4 pin
enb | enableB pin (or 5v arduino)
GND | gnd arduino
5v  | 5v arduino

```cpp

#define upButtonPin 5
#define downButtonPin 4
#define leftButtonPin 3
#define rightButtonPin 2

#define enableA 11
#define in1 9
#define in2 8


int speed;
bool up;
bool down; 
bool left;
bool right;

void driveForwards(int enable, int speed, int leftA, int leftB){
  analogWrite(enable, speed);
  digitalWrite(leftA, HIGH);
  digitalWrite(leftB, LOW);
}

void driveBackwards(int enable, int speed, int leftA, int leftB){
  analogWrite(enable, speed);
  digitalWrite(leftA, LOW);
  digitalWrite(leftB, HIGH);
}

void stop(int enable){
  analogWrite(enable, 0);

}

void setup(){
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("setting up pinModes");
  pinMode(in1, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(in2, OUTPUT);
  for (int i = 2; i <= 5 ;i++){
    pinMode(i, INPUT_PULLUP);
  }
  speed = 255;
  analogWrite(enableA, speed);
  Serial.println("setup complete");
}

void loop(){
  up = !digitalRead(upButtonPin);
  down = !digitalRead(downButtonPin);

  right = !digitalRead(rightButtonPin);
  
  Serial.println(String(up) + " " + String(down) + " " + String(left) + " " + String(right));
  
  if (up) {
    driveForwards(enableA, speed, in1, in2);
  } else if (down) {
    driveBackwards(enableA, speed, in1, in2);
  } else {
    stop(enableA);
  }
  
  /**
  if (left) {
    driveForwards(in1, in2);
  } else if (up) {
    driveForwards(in1, in2);
  }
  **/
}

```


## Challenges 

- get a second motor and expand forward backwards so both motors spin the right directions
- create logic that allows you to drive left and right
  - by stopping one motor 
  - changing the speed of one motor
- Consider getting a distance sensor and if something is closer than 5cm stop moving.
